# Highly Scalable Rate Limiting System Design

## Introduction
A rate limiting system is used to control the rate of incoming requests to a server or API, preventing excessive requests that could cause system instability or outages. In this design, we'll explore the components and technologies needed to build a highly scalable rate limiting system.

## Components

### Load Balancer
A load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers, improving reliability and handling high traffic loads. For this system, we'll use a software load balancer like NGINX or HAProxy, which can be easily scaled up or down depending on demand.

### API Gateway
The API gateway acts as an entry point for all incoming requests and performs routing, authentication, and rate limiting. We'll use Kong, an open-source API gateway, for its robust features, including rate limiting, plugins, and extensibility.

### Redis
Redis is an in-memory key-value data store that can be used to store and manage the state of rate limiting for each user or IP address. We'll use Redis for its speed, scalability, and support for complex data structures.

### Rate Limiter
The rate limiter component tracks the number of requests per second or minute for each user or IP address and enforces limits when necessary. We can use a token bucket algorithm, where a user is assigned a token that is replenished at a set rate, and requests are only allowed if there are available tokens.

### Metrics and Monitoring
To ensure the rate limiting system is working correctly and to detect anomalies or attacks, we'll need a robust monitoring system. We can use Prometheus for collecting metrics and Grafana for visualizing them. In addition, we can use tools like Elasticsearch and Kibana for log analysis and monitoring.

## Technology Choices and Drawbacks

### Load Balancer
NGINX and HAProxy are both widely used software load balancers with excellent performance and scalability. However, they require careful configuration and management to avoid misconfigurations or overload.

### API Gateway
Kong is a popular open-source API gateway that is highly scalable and extensible, with support for multiple plugins and integrations. However, it requires additional setup and configuration, which can add complexity to the system.

### Redis
Redis is a fast and scalable in-memory data store with support for complex data structures and atomic operations. However, it can be vulnerable to security threats like remote code execution and denial-of-service attacks.

### Rate Limiter
The token bucket algorithm is a simple and effective way to limit the rate of incoming requests. However, it can be vulnerable to attacks like token stuffing or distributed attacks from multiple IP addresses.

### Metrics and Monitoring
Prometheus and Grafana are widely used monitoring tools that can provide real-time visibility into the performance and status of the rate limiting system. However, they require additional setup and management, which can add complexity to the system.

## Conclusion
A highly scalable rate limiting system can be achieved through careful component selection and configuration. With the right tools and monitoring, we can ensure the system is secure, performant, and can handle high traffic loads with ease.

### The connections between the components are:

> Requests flow from the Client component to the API Gateway component, which distributes the requests to the Load Balancer component.

> The Load Balancer component routes the requests to the Web Server component.

> The Web Server component calls the Rate Limiter component to check if the request should be rate-limited or not.

> The Rate Limiter component checks the rate limit information stored in the Data Store component to determine whether or not to rate limit the request.

> Metrics are collected from the Web Server component by the Prometheus component, and displayed in Grafana component.
